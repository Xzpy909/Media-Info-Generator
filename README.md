# üé¨ Media Info Generator (Python/FFprobe)

A powerful Python script that utilizes **FFprobe** to scan video files recursively within a directory, extract detailed media information (video, audio, subtitles, bitrate, HDR/Dolby Vision flags), and generate a single, responsive, searchable, dark-themed **HTML report**.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Recursive Scanning:** Automatically finds video files (`.mp4`, `.mkv`, `.avi`, etc.) in the main folder and all subfolders.
* **Detailed Stream Analysis:** Extracts codec, resolution, FPS, bit-depth (including 10-bit/12-bit detection), channels, sample rate, and bitrates.
* **HDR/Dolby Vision Detection:** Flags streams containing **HDR (BT.2020)** and **Dolby Vision** metadata.
* **Bitrate Percentage:** Calculates each video/audio stream's bitrate as a percentage of the overall file bitrate.
* **Organized HTML Output:** Groups media information by their respective folder paths and provides a search bar for quick filtering.
* **Progress Tracking:** Displays an in-terminal progress bar during the media scanning process.
